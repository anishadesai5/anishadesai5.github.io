<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h2>
<h2><strong>Topic for the Hackathon: The Future of Work – A Data Driven Approach</strong></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of our work is changing. Due to the rise in remote work in the post pandemic world, the mental health of employees is being compromised. From working at irregular timings to increased workload due to lay offs, the anxiety and depression levels are at a record high. The impact of mental health problems in the workplace has serious consequences not only for the individual but also for the productivity of the organization. It is imperative for companies to come up with unique solutions to tackle these issues.</p>
	
<p>Therefore, to assist companies in taking care of their employees, we came up with Espoir meaning ‘Hope for the future’. </p>

	    Espoir is your user-friendly application which employees can visit to de-stress. They can also look for options which can help them relax from their busy schedules. 
		Espoir main’s focus is to monitor depression and anxiety levels. From providing a chatbot feature to even booking appointments with therapists, Espoir is here to assist you with all that you need.
		Espoir is built on three core principles:
    </p>

<h2><strong>1) Privacy is our priority.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The surveys provided by employees and interactions with the app will be the private information. 
Eg: If any employee is severely depressed, his/her manager will not know which employee is diagnosed with depression. 
The manager will only get to know the statistics of his entire team and no personal information of any employee will be provided. </p>

<h2><strong>2) Help is at your fingertips</strong></h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Along with our chatbot feature ‘Eva’, employees can go visit our self help resources. 
	The interactive survey can help employees book local hiking trips to drawing classes and much more. 
	They can even book appointments with therapists nearby. 
	Espoir wishes to provide employees as a one stop destination to help de-stress from mental health issues.</p>
	
<strong>3) Real Time Data for Employers</strong></h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The top management can view the statistics for each department. 
	For eg: the demographics of employees, percentage of employees having depression or anxiety in each department, depression or anxiety levels as per different designations and even a trend line comparing mental health issues over the years. 
	We have incorporated a live Tableau dashboard for the management to view the complete statistics</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Implementation of the dream project </strong></span></h2>	

<h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
	<p>
	We didn’t just want to create a web application, we wanted to create an experience – a website which employees would like to visit. 
	Therefore, we thought of the best of the creative graphics and implemented a user-friendly website.
	We used HTML and CSS to create the layout of the app and input various features with the help of Github pages
	</p>

<h3>Website Video Creation</h3>
	<p>
	Even though I can code to my heart’s content and backup the claim by saying “Canva is my jam”. 
	Having worked on Canva for multiple years, I find it to be the best tool for diving into creative aspects.
	</p>
	
<h3>Interact with Chatbot 'EVA' to help you through a rough day</h3>
	<p>
	We also implemented a chatbot feature using one of the free chatbot creating websites. 
	As it was a free trial, the chatbot may not be working now, how it can be viewed on the above video trial 
	</p>

<h3>Tableau Based dashboard to access employee stress levels</h3>
	<p>
	We used Tableau to create a Mental health Dashboard, the same way how we would want the top management to view the statistics. 
	We displayed the following statistics on the dashboard.
	</p>
	
	<ul>
  <li>•	Respondent Demographics</li>
  <li>•	% of workforce having depression or anxiety sorted by company locations</li>
  <li>•	% of workforce having depression or anxiety sorted by designations</li>
</ul>
