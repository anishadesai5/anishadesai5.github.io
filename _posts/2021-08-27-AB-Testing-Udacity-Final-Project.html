<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background</strong></span></h2>
<p> At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". </p>
<li>If the student clicks “start free trial”, they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. </li>
<li>If the student clicks “access course materials”, they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.</li>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Experiment Description</strong></span></h2>
<p> In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked “start free trial”, they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course.</p>
<li>If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. </li>
<li>If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.</li>

<p>Here is a screenshot of what the experiments look like:- </p>

<h2> Hypothesis </h2>

<li><b> Null Hypothesis: </b> This approach might not make a significant change and might not be effective in reducing the early Udacity course cancellation.</li>
<li><b> Alternative Hypothesis: </b> It might reduce the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn’t have enough time, without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course.</li>

<h2> Experiment Setup </h2>
<b>Unit of Diversion: Cookie</b>

<h2> Metric Choice </h2>
<p> Two types of metrics are selected for a successful experiment: Invariant and Evaluation metrics </p>

<h3> Invariant Metrics </h3>
<p>Invariant metrics are used for sanity checks or A/A experiment before running the experiment, such as checking if the distributions are the same between control and experiment group, to make sure our experiment is not inherently wrong.
	Invariant metrics usually have a larger unit of diversion, randomly selected, or happens before the experiment starts. </p>

<li>Number of cookies: Number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. </li>
<li>Number of clicks: Number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger).</li>
<li>Click-through-probability: Number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. </li>

<p>In this case, the goal of measurement is how many students will allocate more than 5 hours a week for Udacity courses, which happens before students enrolling in the courses. 
	And thus the clicks and cookies related metircs are for the invariant metircs.User-id, however, will be tracked after enrolling the course,which is not effective.</p>

<h3> Evaluation Metrics </h3>

<p> Evaluation metrics are the metrics in which we expect to see a change, and are relevant to the business goals we aim to achieve. 
	For each metric we state a Dmin - which marks the minimum change which is practically significant to the business. 
	For instance, stating that any increase in retention that is under 2%, even if statistically significant, is not practical to the business </p>

<li>Gross conversion: Number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button.<li>
<li>Retention: Number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout.<li>
<li> Net conversion: Number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button.<li>
	
<p>Gross Conversion will be a good metric. 
Gross conversion means the number of enrolled divided by number of clicks. 
And thus in the experiment group, we hypothesized the number of enrollment will decrease after answering the screener questions, given those who selected <5 hour will not be encouraged to enroll.</p>

<p> Retention ratio can also be a good evaluation matric because the retention ratio in experiment group is expected to be higher because of low enrolment , 
if experiment meets the assumption. 
After seeing the message , there might be fewer users who would enrol and hence retention would be higher because it should filter out those users who can leave the course as frustrated user. </p>

<p> Net conversion is number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the ”Start free trial” button. 
	As per the intention and assumption of the experiment , experiment group users are made aware that the course require some minimum of hours each week by showing the pop message at the time of enrolment. 
	This message should filter out those users who cannot devote the required hours and are prone to be frustrated later on.
	This ratio should be different among control group users and experiment group users, if experiment’s assumptions holds true.Hence , it can be used as evaluation metric</p>

<p>Gross Conversion, will show us whether we lower our costs by introducing the new pop up. 
	Net conversion will show how the change affects our revenues. 
	After the experiment, we expect that, Gross conversion should have a practically significant decrease, and Net conversion should have a statistically significant increase.</p>
	
<h2>Measuring Standard Deviation of evaluation metrics</h2>

<p>For each of the metrics the standard deviation is calculated for a sample size of 5000 unique cookies visiting the course overview page. 
	It is asked to calculate the variability of the metrics, i.e. standard deviation of them. 
	It is probably the “standard deviation of the sampling distribution” or standard error(SE), rather than the simple SD.</p>

<h3>Topic for the Hackathon: Future of Work - A data-driven approach </h3>
<p>
Graduate students from 30+ universities participated in this Hackathon. More than 50+ teams submitted their ideas, and 3 finalists were chosen. 
For our final round, we modified our app with interactive animations and graphics and won the competition. Three submissions were required for this competition  </p>

<ul>
  <li>A video explaining the objective of our approach</li>
  <li>Application demo video</li>
  <li>Application link</li>
</ul>
	
<p> The final round was conducted live on Zoom with ECS employees as the panelists. Participants were judged on their Question/Answering skills, app design and business approach.</p>
 
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of our work is changing. Due to the rise in remote work in the post pandemic world, the mental health of employees is being compromised. From working at irregular timings to increased workload due to layoffs, the anxiety and depression levels are at a record high. The impact of mental health problems in the workplace has serious consequences not only for the individual but also for the productivity of the organization. It is imperative for companies to come up with unique solutions to tackle these issues.</p>
	
<p>Therefore, to assist companies in taking care of their employees, we came up with <a href = "https://espoir-ecs.github.io/" target="_blank">Espoir</a> meaning ‘Hope for the future’. </p>
	 

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>About Espoir</strong></span></h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	
	    Espoir is your user-friendly application which employees can visit to de-stress. They can also look for options which can help them relax from their busy schedules. 
		Espoir main’s focus is to monitor depression and anxiety levels. From providing a chatbot feature to even booking appointments with therapists, Espoir is here to assist you with all that you need.
		Espoir is built on three core principles:
    </p>
	
<h2><strong>1) Privacy is our priority</strong></h2>

<img src="images/Espoir/1.png">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The surveys provided by employees and interactions with the app will be kept private. 
Eg: If any employee is severely depressed, his/her manager will not know which employee is diagnosed with depression. 
The manager will only get to know the statistics of his entire team and no personal information of any employee will be provided. Interactions with our chatbot 'Eva' will also be kept private. </p>

<h2><strong>2) Help is at your fingertips</strong></h2>

<img src="images/Espoir/2.png">

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Along with our chatbot feature ‘Eva’, employees can go visit our self help resources. 
	The interactive survey can help employees book local hiking trips to drawing classes and much more. 
	They can even book appointments with therapists nearby. 
	Espoir wishes to be the one stop destination for employees to help de-stress them from mental health issues.</p>
	
<h2><strong>3) Real Time Data for Employers</strong></h2>

<img src="images/Espoir/3.png">

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The top management can view the statistics for each department. 
	For eg: the demographics of employees, percentage of employees having depression or anxiety in each department, depression or anxiety levels as per different designations and even a trend line comparing mental health issues over the years. 
	We have incorporated a live Tableau dashboard for the management to view the complete statistics</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Implementation of the dream project </strong></span></h2>

<h3> Github Repository for this app can be found <a href = "https://github.com/anishadesai5/espoir-ecs.github.io" target="_blank"> here </a></h3>	

<h3>Technical Architecture</h3>

<img src="images/Espoir/4.png">

	<p>
	We didn’t just want to create a web application, we wanted to create an experience – a website which employees would like to visit. 
	Therefore, we thought of the best of the creative graphics and implemented a user-friendly website.
	We used HTML and CSS to create the layout of the app and input various features with the help of Github pages.
	</p>

<h3>Website Video Creation</h3>
	<p>
	Even though I can code to my heart’s content and backup the claim by saying “Canva is my jam”. 
	Having worked on Canva for multiple years, I find it to be the best tool for diving into creative aspects.
	</p>
	
<h3>Interact with Chatbot 'EVA' to help you through a rough day</h3>
	<p>
	From our app demo, you can see that we also implemented a chatbot feature using one of the free chatbot creating websites. 
	As it was a free trial for only 14 days, the chatbot may not be working now, however it can be viewed on the above video trial.
	</p>

<h3>Tableau Based dashboard to access employee stress levels</h3>
	<p>
	We used Tableau to create a Mental health Dashboard, the same way how we would want the top management to view the statistics. 
	Additional statistics can be added as per the company requirements.
	</p>
	
<h3>Interactive Survey </h3>
	<p>
	This is our favourite part of the application. We created self-help resources for employees.  
	From tackling unhealthy habits to even recommending various services to employees to do during their free time, this visually appealing interactive survey has it all. 
	We incorporated animations in this segment of the app along with a friendly introduction video. 
	</p>

<h3> Schedule appointment with Medical Personnel </h3>
<p>
Apart from the self app resources in the interactive survey, employees can also book appointments with nearby therapists by simple entering their area codes. 
</p>


<h3> Music Embedding  </h3>
<p>
Lastly, ESPOIR also has a soothing music feature at the top right corner. 
We wanted employees to feel calm while checking ouR Espoir resources and this music feature was helpful in doing so.
</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Summary </strong></span></h2>
<p>
Espoir is an app built for the future of the workplace where mental health should take a higher position in our list of priorities.  
COVID-19 has taken a toll on the world in countless ways, and while rebuilding, there remain certain facets of an average work environment that may require continued efforts to recognize and rectify.	
</p>

<p><i><b> ESPOIR'S VISION IS A WORKSPACE WHERE NO EMPLOYEE IS RESTRAINED BY MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS </i></b></p>
