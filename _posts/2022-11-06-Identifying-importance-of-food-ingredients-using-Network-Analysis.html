<p>
Graph data science is a science driven approach to gain knowledge from the relationships and structures in data, typically to power predictions. 
  It describes a toolbox of techniques that help data scientists answer questions and explain outcomes using graph data </p>

<h3> 
	Python libraries for graphs </h3>

<p> For graph visualization, I’ll be using NetworkX, a Python package dedicated to the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.</p>

<h3>
