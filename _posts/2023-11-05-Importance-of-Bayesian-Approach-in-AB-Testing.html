<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>
Goal is to explain how bayesian approach in AB testing helps to serve a better statement by calculating the probability of the lift percentage after conducting an AB Test</p>

<h2> Experiment Definition </h2>

<p> In an AB Test, we split our users evenly into:

<ol><b>Control</b> They get the old webpage</ol>
<ol><b>Treatment</b>: They get the new webpage</ol>
</p>

<p>Metric we want to track:

We have 3 weeks of logged exposure/conversion data. Let's define these terms:

<li><b>Exposure</b>: A user is bucketed as control or treatment and sees their corresponding page for the first time in the experiment duration</li>
<li><b>Conversion</b>: An exposed user makes a purchase within 7 days of being first exposed</li>
</p>

<p>Questions you should ask when setting up a test:

<li>How do you think the experiment will fair?</li>
<li>Do we have actionable next steps laid out?</li>

</p>

<h2> Data Collection</h2>

<p> Let's use some A/B testing data: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/saraabdelaal/abtestdata"> Kaggle Datasett </a> </p>

Each row is logged when user is exposed to a webpage.

<li><b>timestamp</b>: time the user is first exposed</li>
<li><b>group</b>: bucket</li>
<li><b>landing_page</b>: Which page are they seeing</li>
<li><b>converted</b>: Initialized to 0. Changes to 1 if the user makes a purchase within 7 days of first exposure</li>



<h2> Frequentist Approach vs Bayesian Comparison</h2>

<h2>Beta Distribution explained</h2>

<p> 
The Beta Distribution can be best explained with this article:

The same logic has been used in the code while updating prior parameters with experiment conversion rates

<h2> Advantages of Bayesian over Frequentist </h2>

<p>

<li> Results are more interpretable than the ones we got from the frequentist approach </li>
<li> We can interpret results at any point during the experiment. Don't need to wait for an arbitrary "statsig" </li>
</p>
